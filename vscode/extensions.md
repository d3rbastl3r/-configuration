# Extensions for VSCode
This file describes extensions i am using in VSCode and what i am using the extensions for.

## General
General extensions are extensions which are not bound to a specific project or programming language.

### Draw.io Integration
UML Modeling in VSCode and more. Unofficial extension integrates Draw.io (also known as [diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/)) into VS Code.

### Code Spell Checker
A basic spell checker that works well with code and documents.

There are two extensions:
* Code Spell Checker
* German - Code Spell Checker

Per default is the english variant active, with `F1 -> Enable German Spell Chekcer in Workspace` the spellchecker can be changed to german.
